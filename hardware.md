The majority of the following work was done primarily as a deliverable for a client or company.
This focuses on robots for which I've designed or co-designed the mechanical structure.

In most cases I was also the lead Software Engineer for the robot as well: delivering a control stack and creating applications.

### Revel
The Revel is a 6 degree of freedom robot arm that was the primary product of Svenzva Robotics, a company I cofounded.
It is designed to be affordable but have practical features such as 1.5 kg payload at its 63cm reach.

It was manufactured almost completely in-house and featured a growing collection of accessories- including a gripper attachment to make yarn art.

### BWIBot
This was the 5th iteration of the BWIBot that utilized a fully enclosed body with a mounted Universal Robotics UR5 arm.
It was designed for mobile manipulation with sensors mounted both along the base, for navigation, and behind the mounted arm, for vision.

### Skylark
Skylark is a fully mechanical, cable driven robot that was designed as an exhibit for a children's museum. It featured a see-through enclosure to show onlookers how the motion was being driven by the mechanical controllers.
