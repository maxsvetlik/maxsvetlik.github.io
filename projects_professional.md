# My Projects
This a speed round of the different projects I've worked on professionally.

Some projects have been fleshed out into a blog post digging into more detail.


# Svenzva Robotics
#### I serve as Co-Founder and Head of Software
#### Below are just a few examples of my work at Svenzva

### Development of a Low Cost Robotic Arm

The development of a low-cost, highly capable robotic arm was the primary focus for Svenzva Robotics. The robot was built around so-called smart actuators (Dynamixels) and designed to be able to hold 1.2kg at its full reach position of 63cm and to have 6 degrees of freedom.

With these physical features, along with the capabilities of the servos (data output, integrated control, position/velocity/torque operating modes) the robot is well poised for research and education. The robot remains affordable, however, compared to other robots of similar design.

### Automated String Art

String Art is 60's-era craze that used pegs and string to make 2.5D patterns. There are low-dimension robots that are very good at making string art, but I was  interested if a general purpose 6DOF robot could.

It turns out the answer is yes. The Revel robot uses a gcode-interpreter (written by yours truly) so the art is commanded by a gcode (numerical control) file.


## Socially Intelligent Machines Lab - 2017

### Multi-level Robot Autonomous Navigation and Planning
  
### Integration of a Socially Aware Robot
