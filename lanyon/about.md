I graduated at the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelors degree in Computer Science in 2016. While working on my degree, I was heavily involved in the [Building Wide Intelligence](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/) project lead by Dr. Peter Stone. 

Within the research group I contributed to fundamental research on **human robot interaction**, natural language processing, **robot manipulation** and **robot autonomy** in an office setting. Before graduating I authored a paper on automatically generating curricula for reinforcement learning agents which explored an increase in learning performance over a generated set of transfer tasks in several target games including Ms. Pac Man.

Since graduating I co-founded a robotics hardware company, [Svenzva Robotics](https://svenzva.com), and was the third engineer at the robot start up Diligent Robotics. I later continued research at the University of Texas as a Research Engineer where I, among other things, lead the design of the system architecture for a campus wide autonomous delivery robot (see [here](https://smads.netlify.app)).

I currently work as an AI Engineer at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony) where I engineer software for deep reinforcement learning experiments across a number of target domains. Work within my group can be seen [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358484368_Outracing_champion_Gran_Turismo_drivers_with_deep_reinforcement_learning).

I also generally serve as a consultant for robot hardware and software design as projects and opportunities arise.
