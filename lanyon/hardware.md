title: Robots

The majority of the following work was done primarily as a deliverable for a client or company.
This focuses on robots for which I've designed or co-designed the mechanical structure.

In most cases I was also the lead Software Engineer for the robot as well: delivering a control stack, integrating it and creating applications.

### UT-Chariot

The University of Texas at Austin's [Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory](https://amrl.cs.utexas.edu) commissioned me to design and manufacture a prototype robot mobile platform with:
- an emphasis on propulsion capabilities
- a modest foot print
- beefy compute including a desktop GPU for vision processing
- active cooling for the Texas summers
- reasonable battery life for experiments in the field

I additionally emphasized accessibility (easy ingress for maintenance), electrical flexibility for future sensor additions, and quality of life features for robot operators.

Robot specs at a high level:
- Accelerations of 3 m/s^2
- Maximum velocity of 4.5 m/s (10 miles per hour)
- IP65 rating
- Simultaneous charge and operation; optional shore power for compute with priority
- LAN wired and wireless connectivity
- PC with 32Gb memory, A2000 GPU, Intel i7 11700 and 2 Intel AX200 Wifi NIC

### Revel
The Revel is a 6 degree of freedom robot arm that was the primary product of Svenzva Robotics, a company I cofounded.
It is designed to be affordable but have practical features such as 1.5 kg payload at its 63cm reach.

It was manufactured almost completely in-house and featured a growing collection of accessories- including a hot-swap gripper attachment system. The gripper supported a vaccum gripper system as well as a custom "wand" for the creation of [string art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_art). 

The basis for Revel was to lower the cost of entry into the "fully featured" commercial space of robot arms. The constraints for development were:
- High payload at full reach (1.5 kg)
- Similar reach as a human (63cm)
- Low price point (Under $6500 USD)
- Easy to use and integrate with existing robot platforms
- High accuracy and repeatability

### BWIBot
This was the 5th iteration of the BWIBot as part of the [Building Wide Intelligence project](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/). This robot utilized a fully enclosed body with a mounted Universal Robotics UR5 arm.

It was designed for mobile manipulation in a semi structured environment alongside humans. It featured LiDAR sensors mounted along the base for primary navigation, and RGB-D sensors behind the mounted arm, for vision.

### Skylark
Skylark is a fully mechanical, cable driven robot that was designed as an exhibit for a children's museum. It featured a see-through enclosure to show onlookers how the motion was being driven by the mechanical controllers.
