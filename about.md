I graduated at the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelors degree in Computer Science. While working on my degree, I was heavily involved in the Building Wide Intelligence project where I contributed to fundamental research on human robot interaction, natural language processing, robot manipulation and robot navigation in an office setting. Before graduating I wrote a paper on automatically generating curricula for reinforcement learning agents.

Since graduating I co-founded a robotics hardware company, Svenzva Robotics, worked at robot start up Diligent Robotics, and continued research at the University of Texas as a research engineer. I currently work as an AI Engineer at Sony AI, as well serve as a consultant for robot hardware and software design.
