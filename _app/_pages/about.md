## My ethos
I have a portfolio that is technical, creative and diverse. Most projects I embark upon require a multitude of separate and disparate skills, which displays different facets of the creative and inventive process.

Though I have many interests, robotics directly appeals to this multidisciplinary approach. From designing circuits, hardware design in CAD, fabrication at the CNC and programming the end result, I'm all the things I need to be to build robots and make them useful.

## My Skills
I've been building robots since 2012, programming them since 2014 and designing them since 2016. It can be hard to put a number to some of the skills below, but I've been using **ROS/Linux/Python/C/C++** for robot programming and general software engineering for more than **7 years**.

### Software and Frameworks
Linux, Git, ROS, C/C++, Python, Golang, SQL, Java, Matlab, Docker, Reinforcement Learning, Curriculum Learning 

### Hardware
Solidworks, Fusion360, CAM, CNC, rapid prototyping (FDM, SLA, laser), soldering, welding, 


## My history
I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin in 2016 after involving myself with the [Building Wide Intelligence](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/) project early on and continuing until graduation. 

Since then I've [published research](/publications) on Robotics and AI, worked at Robotics [start-up companies](https://www.diligentrobots.com/) and co-founded my [own](https://svenzva.com). I'm currently a Research Engineer at the University of Texas at Austin's [Texas Robotics](https://robotics.utexas.edu/) supporting research efforts across 5 robotics labs on more than 10 types of ground-based vehicles and robotic manipulators.
