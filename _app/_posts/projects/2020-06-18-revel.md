Designed and manufactured in the USA, Revel was the premiere robot product of my company [Svenzva Robotics](https://svenzva.com). It was designed to be capable robot arm for research and industry with an emphasis on affordability and low mass & electrical footprint. 

Revel can carry 1.5 Kg at full reach, has a total reach of 63 cm, and can be taught quickly to automate tasks. Personally I have taught it to 
- propel itself on a skateboard
- pick up a watering can and water potted plants
- pick up a vinyl record and place it on a record player ([watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcFCbBeEi78))
- automate CNC workflows ([watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8F8DLXMTv8))

## Non-marketed Grippers
Part of the appeal of the Revel Robotic Arm is that it is more customizable than traditional robot arms. A great example of that is add-on Gripper attachment that makes adding new gripper functionality simple and inexpensive.

Through precisely manufactured rack-and-pinion fingers, I designed and fabricated the attachments for

    - a pressure insensitive drawing device that accepts a variety of utensils
    - a flexible thread-and-rod assembly for the making of string art
    - a vacuum suction gripper (see: https://a360.co/2VawAUk) 

along with a sound isolated vacuum system that made pick-n-place tasks a breeze.

# Technical Details
## Design Hardware
Revel is made with aircraft-grade aluminum, machined and constructed in-house. 


## Software Design
Due to afforability and weight constraints, the motors used in the Revel arm do not actively sense torque exerted. Even so, Svenzva developed a dynamic model that allows the robot to be moved by an ourside force, like a human hand, while holding itself up under its own weight.
