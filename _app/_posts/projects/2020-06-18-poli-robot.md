While working as a Software Engineer at the [Socially Intelligent Machines Lab](http://sim.ece.utexas.edu/research.html) I lead the software and hardware integration on a new socially capable robot. This included writing ROS wrappers for components with existing drivers, writing drivers from scratch for those that did not, and writing a technical manual for users of the platform. The robot is currently patent-pending.

The design of the robotâ€™s outward facing appearance was carefully iteraterated, as the robot would be used specifically for human robot interaction research.
Part of the aesthetic design I am most pleased with is the development of the socially expressive eye panel, which has been shown to be useful in non-verbally communicating intent, while users and passer-bys are charmed by the low-resolution LED display. 

You can see the robot (without its protective breastplate) in the video above, and the open source software repository [here](https://github.com/si-machines/poli2). Overall the project was around 300,000 lines of code.
