An un-marketed product of [Svenzva Robotics](http://svenzva.com), these animatronic eyes were designed to have each eye independently controllable and to be robust enough for use in a children's museum exhibit. This design has subsequently been incorporated into custom products, such as an animated eye clock.

The eyes have been designed to be constructed out of aluminum base parts or 3D printed Resin, while the eyes themselves are hand-painted by suppliers of animatronics parts. The motion in the video below is powered by the [Mini Maestro](https://www.pololu.com/product/1352) microcontroller. It also features independent, as well as synchronized, movement of the eyes.
