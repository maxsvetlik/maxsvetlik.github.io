I"<p>An un-marketed product of <a href="http://svenzva.com">Svenzva Robotics</a>, these animatronic eyes were designed to have each eye independently controllable and to be robust enough for use in a childrenâ€™s museum exhibit. This design has subsequently been incorporated into custom products, such as an animated eye clock.</p>

<p>The eyes have been designed to be constructed out of aluminum base parts or 3D printed Resin, while the eyes themselves are hand-painted by suppliers of animatronics parts. The motion in the video below is powered by the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1352">Mini Maestro</a> microcontroller. It also features independent, as well as synchronized, movement of the eyes.</p>
