String Art is 60â€™s-era craze that used pegs and string to make 2.5D patterns. There are low-dimension robots that are very good at making string art, but I was interested if a general purpose 6DOF robot could.</p>

<p>It turns out the answer is yes. This weekend project has two components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A gcode interpreter</li>
  <li>A gcode generator</li>
</ul>

<p>Gcode was chosen since it is already a common place, well defined control spec. If a customer wanted to use this as the basis for an industrial gcode controller, they very well could.<br />
The gcode is generated based on a parameterized file that specifies the physics of the workspace and art piece. E.g. the number and size of the pegs, the layout and the overall diameter.</p>

<p>This project also required designing a custom gripper attachment that allowed the robot to hold a spool of thread, while having a compliant end-effector so interaction with the pegs would not be damaging to the robot or the workpiece.</p>
