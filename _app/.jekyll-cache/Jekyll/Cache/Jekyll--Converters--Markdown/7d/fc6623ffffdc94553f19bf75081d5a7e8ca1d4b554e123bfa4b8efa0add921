<h2 id="my-ethos">My ethos</h2>
<p>I have a portfolio that is technical, creative and diverse. Most projects I embark upon require a multitude of separate and disparate skills, which displays different facets of the creative and inventive process.</p>

<p>Though I have many interests, robotics directly appeals to this multidisciplinary approach. From designing circuits, hardware design in CAD, fabrication at the CNC and programming the end result, Iâ€™m all the things I need to be to build robots and make them useful.</p>

<h2 id="my-skills">My Skills</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve been building robots since 2012, programming them since 2014 and designing them since 2016. It can be hard to put a number to some of the skills below, but Iâ€™ve been using <strong>ROS/Linux/Python/C/C++</strong> for robot programming and general software engineering for more than <strong>7 years</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="software-and-frameworks">Software and Frameworks</h3>
<p>Linux, Git, ROS, C/C++, Python, Golang, SQL, Java, Matlab, Docker, Reinforcement Learning, Curriculum Learning</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>
<p>Solidworks, Fusion360, CAM, CNC, rapid prototyping (FDM, SLA, laser), soldering, welding,</p>

<h2 id="my-history">My history</h2>
<p>I received my BS in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin in 2016 after involving myself with the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/">Building Wide Intelligence</a> project early on and continuing until graduation.</p>

<p>Since then Iâ€™ve <a href="/publications">published research</a> on Robotics and AI, worked at Robotics <a href="https://www.diligentrobots.com/">start-up companies</a> and co-founded my <a href="https://svenzva.com">own</a>. Iâ€™m currently a Research Engineer at the University of Texas at Austinâ€™s <a href="https://robotics.utexas.edu/">Texas Robotics</a> supporting research efforts across 5 robotics labs on more than 10 types of ground-based vehicles and robotic manipulators.</p>
