I"^<p>The Brass Knox guitar bridge is an all-metal guitar bridge that is designed to be used on steel-stringed classical guitars and nominally turns the guitar into a harp with a fixed set of tones.</p>

<p>The bridge can be positioned and adjusted to accommodate a number of different open-string notes.</p>

<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>
<p>The first version of the Brass Knox bridge was made out of aluminum with a high degree of natural compliance, allowing the user to tune strings with more tension than would be otherwise possible. This maximizes flexibility and customizability, but reduces the ‘cleanliness’ of the sound by increasing the surface area of the string in contact with the bridge.</p>
