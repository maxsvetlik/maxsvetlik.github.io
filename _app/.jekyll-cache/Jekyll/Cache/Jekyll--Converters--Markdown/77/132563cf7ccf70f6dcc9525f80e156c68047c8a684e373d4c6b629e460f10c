I"¸<p>While working as a Software Engineer at the <a href="http://sim.ece.utexas.edu/research.html">Socially Intelligent Machines Lab</a> I lead the software and hardware integration on a new socially capable robot. This included writing ROS wrappers for components with existing drivers, writing drivers from scratch for those that did not, and writing a technical manual for users of the platform. The robot is currently patent-pending.</p>
