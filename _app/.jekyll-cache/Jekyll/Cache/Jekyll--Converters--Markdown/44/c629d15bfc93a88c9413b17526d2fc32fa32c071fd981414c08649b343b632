<p>Designed and manufactured in the USA, Revel was the premiere robot product of my company <a href="https://svenzva.com">Svenzva Robotics</a>. It was designed to be capable robot arm for research and industry with an emphasis on affordability and low mass &amp; electrical footprint.</p>

<p>Revel can carry 1.5 Kg at full reach, has a total reach of 63 cm, and can be taught quickly to automate tasks. Personally I have taught it to</p>
<ul>
  <li>propel itself on a skateboard</li>
  <li>pick up a watering can and water potted plants</li>
  <li>pick up a vinyl record and place it on a record player (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcFCbBeEi78">watch</a>)</li>
  <li>automate CNC workflows (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8F8DLXMTv8">watch</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Part of the appeal of the Revel Robotic Arm is that it is more customizable than traditional robot arms. A great example of that is add-on Gripper attachment that makes adding new gripper functionality simple and inexpensive.</p>

<p>Through precisely manufactured rack-and-pinion fingers, I designed and fabricated the attachments for</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- a pressure insensitive drawing device that accepts a variety of utensils
- a flexible thread-and-rod assembly for the making of string art
- a vacuum suction gripper (see: https://a360.co/2VawAUk) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>along with a sound isolated vacuum system that made pick-n-place tasks a breeze.</p>

# Technical Details
## Design Hardware
Revel is made with aircraft-grade aluminum, machined and constructed in-house. 


## Software Design
Due to afforability and weight constraints, the motors used in the Revel arm do not actively sense torque exerted. Even so, Svenzva developed a dynamic model that allows the robot to be moved by an ourside force, like a human hand, while holding itself up under its own weight.
